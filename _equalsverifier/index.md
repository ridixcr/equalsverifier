Quick start
-----------
EqualsVerifier 2.0 requires Java 7 or higher. EqualsVerifier 1.x requires Java 6 or higher.

If you are upgrading from version 1 to version 2, please see the [migration guide](/equalsverifier/migration1to2).

### Get EqualsVerifier.
* Maven users, add this to your POM:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>nl.jqno.equalsverifier</groupId>
    <artifactId>equalsverifier</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.8</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

* ANT users, make sure the most recent EqualsVerifier jar is on the classpath. You can download it from [maven.org](http://search.maven.org/#search&#124;gav&#124;1&#124;g%3A%22nl.jqno.equalsverifier%22%20AND%20a%3A%22equalsverifier%22).

EqualsVerifier doesn't have any dependencies of its own.

### Use, as follows, in your unit test:
{% highlight java %}
@Test
public void equalsContract() {
    EqualsVerifier.forClass(My.class).verify();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Or, if you prefer to use a `getClass()` check instead of an `instanceof` check in the body of your `equals` method:

{% highlight java %}
@Test
public void equalsContract() {
    EqualsVerifier.forClass(My.class)
            .usingGetClass()
            .verify();
}
{% endhighlight %}

With some warnings suppressed:

{% highlight java %}
@Test
public void equalsContract() {
    EqualsVerifier.forClass(My.class)
            .suppress(Warning.NONFINAL_FIELDS, Warning.NULL_FIELDS)
            .verify();
}
{% endhighlight %}

When EqualsVerifier detects a problem, it will explain what it thinks is wrong. In some cases (mostly when it needs more information), it will say what to do to fix the problem.
